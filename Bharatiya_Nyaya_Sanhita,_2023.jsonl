Nothing which is done in pursuance of, or which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court; if done whilst such judgment or order remains in force, is an offence,notwithstanding the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such judgment or order,provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the Court had such jurisdiction. 17.

Explanation. \u2014 It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing theact with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.

Here, if A alters his coursewithout any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoidingthe danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may rundown the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be foundas a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him inincurring the risk of running down the boat C.

A person abets the doing of a thing, who\u2014 (a) instigates any person to do that thing; or (b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or (c) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. Explanation 1.\u2014A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attemptsto cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. Illustration . A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court to apprehend Z. B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C. Explanation 2. \u2014Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act. 46. A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. Explanation 1. \u2014The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. Explanation 2. \u2014To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should becaused. Illustration s. (a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. (b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. Explanation 3.\u2014It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.Abetment of thing.

(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person with mental illness to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, isguilty of abetting an offence. (b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z\u2019s death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in theabsence of A and thereby causes Z\u2019s death. Here, though B was not capable by law ofcommitting an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capableby law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject tothe punishment of death. (c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of his mental illness, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong orcontrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A\u2019s instigation. B has committed nooffence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liableto the punishment provided for that offence. (d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z\u2019s possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes theproperty out of Z\u2019s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A\u2019s property. B, acting underthis misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A isguilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. Explanation 4. \u2014The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence. Illustration . A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B\u2019s instigation. B is liable to be punished for hisoffence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A isalso liable to the same punishment. Explanation 5. \u2014It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It issufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. Illustration . A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, butwithout mentioning A\u2019s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it toB for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z diesin consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engagedin the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed theoffence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. 47.

Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Sanhita for the punishment of suchabetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. Explanation. \u2014 An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, orwith the aid which constitutes the abetment. Illustration s. (a) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.

A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to thepunishment for murder. 50. Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with thepunishment provided for the offence which would have been committed if the act had beendone with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other. 51.When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had directly abetted it: Provided that the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of theconspiracy which constituted the abetment. Illustration s. (a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into thefood of Y , which is by the side of that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influenceof A\u2019s instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence ofthe abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated thechild to put the poison into the food of Y . (b) A instigates B to burn Z\u2019s house, B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is notguilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequenceof the burning. (c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, andbeing resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probableconsequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for murder. 52.

When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment,causes a different effect from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effectcaused, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had abetted the act with theintention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the act abetted was likely to causethat effect.

Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with theknowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpablehomicide. Illustration s. (a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm,treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. (b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z\u2019s death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z.Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. (c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was notguilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an actthat he knew was likely to cause death. Explanation 1.\u2014A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other,shall be deemed to have caused his death.Selling childfor purposesofprostitution,etc. Buying child for purposes ofprostitution,etc. Culpable homicide.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45"}
{"page": 45, "text": "32 Explanation 2.\u2014Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to properremedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented. Explanation 3.\u2014The causing of the death of a child in the mother\u2019s womb is not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if anypart of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or beencompletely born. 99. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder,\u2013\u2013 (a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death; or (b) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the personto whom the harm is caused; or (c) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficientin the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or (d) if the person committing the act by which the death is caused, knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodilyinjury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. Illustration s. (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. (b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A,not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, orsuch bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. (c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder,although he may not have intended to cause Z\u2019s death. (d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill anyparticular individual. Exception 1.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person whogave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident: Provided that the provocation is not,\u2013\u2013 (a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person; (b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant; (c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.

{"page": 46, "text": "33 Illustration s. (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y , Z\u2019s child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, andthe death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by theprovocation. (b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y , neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight.A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thingdone by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A\u2019s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion bythese words, and kills Z. This is murder. (e) A attempts to pull Z\u2019s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion inconsequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. (f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B\u2019s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B\u2019s hand for thatpurpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but Ais guilty of murder. Exception 2.\u2014 Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defencewithout premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary forthe purpose of such defence. Illustration . Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committedmurder, but only culpable homicide. Exception 3.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powersgiven to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. Exception 4.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender\u2019shaving taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Explanation.\u2014 It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. Exception 5.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his ownconsent. Illustration . A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z\u2019s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to hisown death; A has therefore abetted murder.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45"}

CHAPTER XVII O F OFFENCES AGAINST PROPERTY 301. (1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person\u2019s consent, moves that property in order tosuch taking, is said to commit theft. Explanation 1.\u2014A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft assoon as it is severed from the earth. Explanation 2.\u2014A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. Explanation 3.\u2014A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as byactually moving it. Explanation 4.\u2014A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused,is moved by that animal. Explanation 5.\u2014The consent mentioned in this sectionmay be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purposeauthority either express or implied. Illustrations. (a) A cuts down a tree on Z\u2019s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in orderto such taking, he has committed theft. (b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\u2019s dog to follow it. Here, if A\u2019s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, Ahas committed theft as soon as Z\u2019s dog has begun to follow A. (c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock beginsto move, A has committed theft of the treasure. (d) A being Z\u2019s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\u2019s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z\u2019s consent. A has committed theft. (e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\u2019s possession.It could not therefore be taken out of Z\u2019s possession, and A has not committed theft, thoughhe may have committed criminal breach of trust.Trespassing onburial places,etc. Uttering words, etc., withdeliberateintent towound religiousfeelings.

(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\u2019s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in aplace where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of takingthe ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time offirst moving the ring, commits theft. (i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as asecurity, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\u2019s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly. (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z\u2019s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takesit dishonestly. (k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though thewatch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. HereA takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.

Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z\u2019simplied consent to use Z\u2019s book. If this was A\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft. (n) A asks charity from Z\u2019s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z\u2019s wife is authorisedto give away alms. If this was A\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft. (o) A is the paramour of Z\u2019s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. IfA takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\u2019s own property, takes that property out of Z\u2019s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does notcommit theft. (2) Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of secondor subsequent conviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished withrigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extendto five years and with fine: Provided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five thousand rupees, and a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the valueof property or restoration of the stolen property, shall be punished with community service.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45"}

The Government alsoconsidered to make existing laws relevant to the contemporary situation and provide speedyjustice to common man. Accordingly, various stakeholders were consulted keeping in mindcontemporary needs and aspirations of the people and with a view to create a legal structurewhich is citizen centric and to secure life and liberty of the citizens. 4.
